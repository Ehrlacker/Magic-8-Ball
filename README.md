# Magic-8-Ball

This is a project that i've worked on through Codecademy. It is based on the magic 8 ball toy. With the magic 8 ball toy, you ask it a question and then you shake it. Once you shake the 8 ball it displays one of many possible answers to your question. First I defined a variable named userName which I use to output my name. Then I defined and assigned the variable userQuestion which is the question that I will be asking the Magic 8 Ball. Then I wanted my magic 8 ball to have 7 possible answers so first I used the Math.random function to select a random number between 0 and 1. I then multiplied that number by 8 because I wanted it to be a number between 0 and 7.9. I used Math.floor with it so that number would rand down to the nearest whole number. Then i defined and assigned the variable eightBall. Next I used a switch statement to write the 7 random results that would display. Finally I used console.log to print a statement before printing out the random variable.
